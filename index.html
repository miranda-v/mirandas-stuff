      This is a brief preface to my depository. If you're reading this, chances are you know me. If you don't know me, then I am really confused as to how you arrived here. At any rate, this is only where I will be practicing my HTML coding. It's not going to have any juicy information on it, tough luck if that's what you wanted to see.
